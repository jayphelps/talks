# Talks

A list of the talks I can/will/have given. If you're interested in me giving one of these talks or a totally different one, reach out via email [speaking@jayphelps.com](mailto:speaking@jayphelps.com) or PM me https://twitter.com/_jayphelps. Although I can speak about a large range of topics, I'm most passionate about Reactive Programming, RxJS, Compilers, WebAssembly, JavaScript standards, TypeScript, Flow, Reason, Dart, Rust, LLVM, etc.

## The WebAssembly Revolution Has Begun

- QCon SF - [Website](https://qconsf.com/sf2017/sf2017/speakers/jay-phelps.html)

WebAssembly (aka wasm) is a new, standardized compilation target for the web, shipping in all modern browsers. But since it's so low level it can be difficult to see how it will revolutionize the next generation of web apps–and definitely not just games and C++. This is a game changer for all web developers.

In this talk Jay will reveal what it is, how you can use it today, and the incredible opportunities it will unlock in the years to come.

> This talk is nearly the same as my _WebAssembly Demystified_ talk, except it assumes the listener already has a fairly solid understanding of native languages like C/C++. It touches on more advanced topics than the other one, and keeps some of the familiar things (like stack machines) brief.

## WebAssembly Demystified
## (alternative title) Help me WebAssembly, you're my only hope!

- All Things Open - [Website](https://allthingsopen.org/talk/webassembly-demystified/)

A revolution is about to begin. WebAssembly (aka wasm) is shipping in all modern browsers, but since it's (intentionally) very low level, it can be difficult to understand how it will be critical to future web applications--and definitely not just games and C++!

In this talk, Jay will demystify stack assembly languages like WebAssembly, even if you have zero experience with assembly and linear memory.

> This talk is nearly the same as my _The WebAssembly Revolution Has Begun_ talk, except that it assumes the listener may not have C/C++ experience, nor any assembly language experience. Understanding the fundamentals of a stack machine is very helpful to understanding what WebAssembly is fundamentally, so this particular talk elaborates on it.

## React, Powered by WebAssembly

- Reactathon - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ccNDxRqpo)

WebAssembly (aka wasm) is a new, standardized compilation target for the web, available in all modern browsers. But since it's so low level it can be difficult to see how it will revolutionize the future generations of React apps and potentially even power React itself. In this talk Jay will reveal what it is, how you can use it today, and the incredible opportunities it will continue to unlock.


## RxJS, Welcome to Reactive Programming

Have you heard of RxJS? Most.js? Bacon.js? All of these are the hot libraries to accomplish one thing: Reactive Programming, which refers to the handling of things Reactively by having changes propagate automatically--You know how in Microsoft Excel if cell C1 equals `A1 + B1` and either A1 or B1 update, C1 will too? That's the idea behind Reactive Programming!

In this talk, Jay Phelps will introduce you to the concepts of Reactive Programming, using RxJS and Observables as the de facto example, so that you can empower your applications with modern, clean code.


## RxJS 201, Mastering Reactive Programming

You may (or may not) know RxJS, but once you've dived into it you may quickly hit a wall where it's tough to find more advanced topics and patterns, and it's still unclear how to use it for more than the simplest things. In this talk Jay will take your skills to that next level where you'll start to think about Reactive Programming as the core paradigm to architect your code in. A whole new world opens up.


## TypeScript vs. Flow - The Informed Choice Is Yours

TypeScript and Flow are the two most popular typed extensions to JavaScript, but very often teams are torn between which one they should choose? At face value they can seem nearly identical--especially syntactically--but there are some very fundamental differences between them that people are often surprised to learn later.

Let's learn the objective differences and semantics between the two, and compare the pros and cons of each depending on your desired goals and preferences. Spoiler alert: this talk will not choose a clear winner for all because there isn't one!


## Why I love JSX!

- Reactathon - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL-J3pLIAok)

JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to JavaScript, popularized by React. When seen for the first time it can often elicit bad memories of intermixing HTML and code, but JSX is *very* different! Let's learn exactly what it is, how it works, and even how you can use it outside of React.


## RxJS + Redux + React = Amazing! The introduction of redux-observable

- Netflix HQ Series - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AslncyG8whg)
- Modern Web - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGAKRIBDMS0)
- Real World React - [Website](https://www.meetup.com/Real-World-React/events/235091101/)

Jay Phelps talks about why Netflix loves reactive programming with Rx. In this talk he shares the basics of RxJS 5 Observables and how they can be used with React and Redux to manage asynchronous effects using redux-observable.


## Real-time Insights Powered By Reactive Programming (RETIRED)

- Netflix HQ Series - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uODxUJ5Jwis)

The time it takes you to debug your systems is critical, both in production and development. In this talk Jay Phelps reveals how we harness the power of Reactive Programming with RxJS and RxJava to provide real-time querying and transformation of extremely high volume logs.


## The Past, Present, and Future of JavaScript (RETIRED)

- QCon SF - [Website](https://qconsf.com/sf2016/sf2016/users/jay-phelps.html)

JavaScript has come a long way from its humble beginning at Netscape. Jay Phelps leads a discussion with Jafar Husain and Stefan Penner (both members of the TC39 standards body) through the history of the specification process and reveal some exciting new features (hopefully!) coming to a browser near you. ES2015 and beyond.


## ES2015 & Beyond with Jay Phelps (RETIRED)

- Mountain View JavaScript/Modern Web - [Website](https://www.meetup.com/javascript-9/events/227253873/) - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P7hwhvlwig)

Let's take a deep dive into some of the new features of ECMAScript 2015, the specification that defines JavaScript. Classes, arrow functions, and more.

Then we'll peek at what's coming in ES2016 and even discuss rumored features yet to be revealed!


## The Coveted Universal Web Component Format (RETIRED)

- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywkDHUMICCc)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNeK4Kplo9g)

We love Ember, but wouldn't it be great if the components we want or create were host framework agnostic? W3C Web Components aims to do this, but it’s missing a large part of the story. Graffiti fills in these gaps using HTMLBars, ES6/7++ syntax to let you experience the future, now. Kumbaya, all the frameworks can now hold hands.
